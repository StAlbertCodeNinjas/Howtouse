# IMPORTANT!!!

Do not make any changes to the Github or work in Git Bash without a sensei there to help you!

# HowToUse

Each belt has a repository, and each ninja in the belt has a branch within that repository. You will upload your projects to your branch, and you can download support files from the main branch.

# Download Support Files

In your branch, you will find all of your support files, which can be downloaded as you need them. Click on the file you need to download and click the **three dots** to the right of the file information. Click **Download** and your file will begin downloading to the downloads folder on your desktop.

# Upload Your Project Files
To do so, navigate to your branch and click **Add File**. Drag in your files (finished projects, any assets you made or downloaded from the Unity store) and commit the change.

# Upload Projects Bigger Than 25MB

1. Open Git Bash by searching for it in the start menu on the desktop. You will have to do some command line programming to push bigger files!
2. Open the File Explorer. Click **This PC**, then **Windows (C:)**, then **Users**, then **CN-Ninja**. Drag your project file into the folder for the belt you're in (Purple, Brown, Red, or Black).
3. In Git Bash, type **cd** and then drag the folder for your belt into Git Bash. The file path should appear in your command. Hit enter to run it.
4. Type **git add** then drag the file from your belt folder into Git Bash. The file path should appear in your command. Hit enter to run it.
5. Once the file is added, you will need to commit it. Type **git commit -m ""** and type a short description of the project in between the quotation marks "". Hit enter to run the command.
6. Finally, you will need to push it to github. Type **git push origin main:Firstname-LastInitial** and hit enter to run it. As an example, Sensei Ash would type **git push origin main:Ash-R**.
7. Open Github and navigate to your branch of the belt repository you are in. You should see your project file there!
